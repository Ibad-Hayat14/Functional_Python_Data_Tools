# Functional Python Data Tools

A collection of six real-world Python mini-projects showcasing how to apply **functional programming concepts** like `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, `lambda`, **generators**, and **iterators** to solve practical business, healthcare, and academic problems.

> Ideal for students, data analysts, and Python developers looking to build a strong, portfolio-worthy foundation in Python data workflows.

- Calculates averages
- Applies manual iterator logic

### 03. Customer Churn Detection
- Flags inactive customers
- Tags risk level: High, Medium, Low
- Applies tiered discounts
- Uses `reduce()` for reporting

### 04. Employee Timesheet Analyzer
- Parses clock-in/clock-out times
- Computes daily hours via generators
- Tags employee workload status

### 05. Sales Commission Tracker
- Applies commission rules using `map()`
- Filters top-performing sales
- Tags employees for bonus eligibility

### 06. Patient Monitoring & Alert System
- Cleans patient vital signs
- Flags unstable conditions
- Generates alert messages using generators
- Averages stats using `reduce()`
